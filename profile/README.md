## ... a bit more detail

**AI quickstarts** are straight-forward, ready-to-run examples that 
demonstrate **real business use cases** on your Red Hat AI platform. They go 
beyond technical demos to showcase how open source AI delivers value and 
innovation. They are here to jump-start your journey and help you get the most 
out of Red Hat AI.

Many of these examples come straight from Red Hat AI experts. After all, this 
is our day job! Contributions from Red Hat partners and the community are not 
just welcome, they are *encouraged*.
